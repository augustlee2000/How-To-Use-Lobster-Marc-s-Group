# How-To-Use-Lobster-Marc-s-Group

This repository is set up for basic scripts so that if you have no idea how to use lobster and really don't want to learn you copy and paste over and hopefully it should work!

I am by no means an expert on this subject any, if you have any actually debuging issues you should email Hannah Nelson (hnelson2@nd.edu) or ask the slack channel which I or Hannah will be able to help you find
